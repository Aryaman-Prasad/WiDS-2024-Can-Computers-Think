This project focuses on introducing you to the world of Reinforcement Learning by solving puzzles (and interacting with us....) in the most fun way possible!!!!

## Week 0:

In the Week 0, we want you to learn Python (Python is a good relief if you're bored of C++ from CS 101 this sem) and modules like numpy, pandas and matplotlib (They are the goto libraries and the first imported when you're starting with any DS project, so it's good to have a grasp on them)

Choose whatever resource suits you and get acquainted with the modules to move forward with the project.

### Resources for Python

This is something I just googled and found, looks good for programmers (who did CS 101 in prior)

Codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python-for-programmers

This is a good video but long, should keep you occupied for a bit.

Programming with Mosh: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?si=gfn-7_-chO-J60hD)

### Resources for Numpy

### Resources for Pandas

### Resources for Matplotlib

You can just look up what plot you want at that moment for matplotlib or

## Week 1:

In this week, you're gonna work on the Multi-Bandit Problem from Sutton and Barto (available in the resources folder)

You're going to implement the greedy and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithms and observe how one is better than the other and make changes
